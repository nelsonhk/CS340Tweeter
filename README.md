# CS340Tweeter

In this project I implement a social media application, somewhat like a simplified version of Twitter or Instagram.

Front end is implemented in Android. Design patterns used include MVP layering, generic types, template method, observer, facade, and more.

Back end is implemented using AWS Lambda, SQS, and DynamoDB.

See Diagrams/Scripts folder for documentation.
